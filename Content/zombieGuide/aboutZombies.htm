        <h1><a name="top"></a>About Zombies</h1>
        <p>Zombies are undead creatures. They were once alive but now are walking corpses. The CDC, before it was completely destroyed by a walking time bomb provided the following definition:</p>
        <p>"A zombie is an animated body of a previously living creature. It does not feel pain and has a one minded focus to consume temporal fluid. A zombie can be any once living creature."</p>
        <h2>Some key factors to know about zombies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>They can only be "killed" by cutting off their heads or burning them</li>
            <li>Their bite will turn you into a zombie</li>
            <li>They hunt in packs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Zombie spores</h2>
        <p>If a dispatched zombie is not burned or buried they will begin to give off spores after an hour or so. At this point, if the spores are breathed in there is a good chance that you will become a zombie in under a day.</p>
