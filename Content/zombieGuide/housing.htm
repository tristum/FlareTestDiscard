        <p>If you live in the country, good luck.</p>
        <p>If you live in a city, we suggest the sewers, they do not seem to like going down there. You can also try penthouses as they do not like climbing too high up into buildings. Usually any floor beyond the 10th is good for living.</p>
        <p>Finding food is another matter.</p>
