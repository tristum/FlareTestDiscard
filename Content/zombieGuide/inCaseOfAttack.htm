        <h1>In Case of Zombie Attack</h1>
        <p>Hopefully you have taken precautions against this inevitability (see <MadCap:xref href="preventDeath.htm">Prevent Your Death</MadCap:xref>). At this point there are several things you can do.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not panic</li>
            <li>Remain in your group</li>
            <li>Choose the most appropriate formation</li>
            <li>If using guns fire at the head</li>
            <li>Be ready to commit to a strategic retreat</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This will be much more difficult if you have not heeded the precautions necessary, such as no armor or not remaining in a group. At this point your best option is to run and hide.</p>
