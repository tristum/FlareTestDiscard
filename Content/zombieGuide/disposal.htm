        <h1>Disposal</h1>
        <p>If you are fortunate enough to have killed many zombies, firstly, we salute you, secondly, it is important to dispose of them in the correct manner.</p>
        <p>Here are the key factors for disposal</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not bury them. If buried, zombies will rise again. We do not know why.</li>
            <li>Burn them, preferably in an enclosed area such as an incinerator. Wear gas masks when doing so as the particles from their rotted flesh are dangerous and can cause zombie rot. Burn them as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li>Do not leave dormant zombies where they lie. Their rotted flesh will begin to give off particles which if breathed will cause our bodies to rot and we will die in under a day.</li>
        </ul>
