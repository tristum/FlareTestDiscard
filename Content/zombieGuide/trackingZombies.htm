        <h1>Tracking Zombies</h1>
        <p>You may sometimes find yourself with the need to track down zombies. Perhaps a loved one has been stolen away, or perhaps you are seeking revenge after a successful attack on their part. Whatever the reasons, you will find it easy to track zombies. Most of the time.</p>
        <p>They usually drag their feet when moving from place to place, though they are fast when they see prey. You should be able to see where they dragged their feet if moving over soft earth.</p>
        <p>If on streets they may leave behind clothing or whole body parts. </p>
        <p>If a nest is nearby you will not need to track them. You will hear the unceasing cries of the zombie victims.</p>
